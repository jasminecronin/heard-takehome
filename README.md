# Heard Take-Home Assignment

This is a simple CRUD app containing a frontend, backend, and local database for the purposes of the technical take-home assessment from Heard.

## To Run the App

### Prerequisites

1. Download and install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download

### Instructions
1. Clone this repo to your local machine and open the root directory.
2. Open a terminal in the `/backend` folder and run the following. This will start up the backend server.
```
npm install && npm run dev
```
3. Open a **new** terminal in the `/frontend` folder and run the same command. This will start up the frontend client.
```
npm install && npm run dev
```
4. With both terminals open, navigate to `localhost:5173` in your browser.
5. A list of transactions from the database should render. You can add records, update records, or delete them.
6. To stop the server & client, close both terminals.
